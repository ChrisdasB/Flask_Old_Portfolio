<table class="table w-75 mx-auto text-light bg-dark-trans">    
    <tr>
        
        <td class="text-start"><p>In my personal education at ILS to become a IT-Systemadministrator, i was briefly introduced to programming.
            In this course, i build a small website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, mySQL and PHP.
            That was in the middle of 2020. I left the sales-branche, to work in IT.
            While i had to learn a completly new job that had nothing to do with programming, i still spend a lot of my freetime with coding.
            I started the journey at <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp.org</a> to solidify my basic knowledge in programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            After that, i dived deep into games development with <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a> and learned to work with C#.
            Along this way, i learned the prcinciple of object orientated programming, since it is a must know to work with Unity.
            I finished 2 small games, where i used OOP and i really learned how to handle a bunch of data in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the middle of 2022 i decided, that i want to enter development professionaly and startet taking the course <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/">'CS50'</a> from the Harvard University.
            This course really gave me a deeper insight into programming. While using C, i understood the most basic principals of computers.
        </p>
        <p>
            I learned the principals of memory management, diverse algorythms and how to rate them with asimtotic notations, to build my own data structure, 
            solve problems but most importantly how to educate myselft in this field.
        </p>
        <p>
            The field of programming facinates me. If i am in a project, i tend to forget everything around me. If i face frustrating problems, i never stop until is solve them.
            I am sure, that my mindset it right for a professional career in this field.
        </p>
        <p>
            What i need now, is the time to focus on it and get mentoring from experienced developers.
